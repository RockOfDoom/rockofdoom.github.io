      <p>Welcome to the Midnight House! I am Alex Basinski (alias RockOfDoom), an aspiring
        game designer who is currently attending the University of California, Santa Cruz.
        As of right now, I am largely a writerâ€”narrative is my strongest suit, and the few
        games I have made so far feature it heavily. However, I am very excited to be branching
        out into the worlds of 3d art and animation, and I'm not the worst programmer out there
        to boot. I also hold a lot of love in my heart for tabletop RPGs, and I've been having
        a LOT of fun branching out from Dungeons and Dragons lately. When I'm not playing or
        making games, I spend my time voraciously devouring books, feebly attempting to draw,
        consuming anime and cartoons at an unhealthy rate (don't worry I have good taste I swear),
        and thinking about short stories / worldbuilding concepts that I will never ever write.
        Well, maybe I'll write them. Eventually.</p>
      <p>This page is a repository for all of my work. Well, okay, not all of it. This page
        is a repository for all of my work that I am willing to share publicly. If you like
        what you see, let me know! I've put a couple places where you can contact me below, and
        I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to share this page around, but don't lift any of the
        artwork or games from it! Unless otherwise noted, I made all of this stuff and I would prefer
        to get the proper credit ;p</p>
      <p>Also, this page is a huge work in progress! Stuff is gonna break and get moved around,
        so, sorry in advance?</p>
